## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Visual Studio 2022, VS Code, or Rider
- Git

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SmartOrderBy.git
   cd SmartOrderBy
   ```

2. **Restore Dependencies**
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Build the Project**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

4. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## Coding Standards

### C# Coding Standards

- Follow [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions)
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation for public APIs
- Keep methods small and focused
- Use SOLID principles
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Code Style

- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Use PascalCase for public members
- Use camelCase for private members and parameters
- Use meaningful names that describe the purpose
- Add comments for complex logic

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Sorts the queryable collection based on the specified sorting criteria.
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of elements in the collection.</typeparam>
/// <param name="queryable">The queryable collection to sort.</param>
/// <param name="sorting">The sorting criteria to apply.</param>
/// <returns>A sorted queryable collection.</returns>
public static IQueryable<T> OrderBy<T>(this IQueryable<T> queryable, Sorting sorting)
{
    if (sorting == null || string.IsNullOrEmpty(sorting.Name))
        return queryable;

    // Implementation details...
}
```

## Testing

### Test Requirements

- All new functionality must have corresponding tests
- Tests should cover both positive and negative scenarios
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run specific test project
dotnet test test/SmartOrderBy.Test/

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
```

### Test Naming Convention

```csharp
[Test]
public void OrderBy_WithValidSorting_ReturnsSortedCollection()
{
    // Test implementation
}

[Test]
public void OrderBy_WithNullSorting_ReturnsOriginalCollection()
{
    // Test implementation
}
```
